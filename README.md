##### NOTE: Used /weather-bot as an example: http://www.yravi.com/2016/03/25/writing-a-custom-slash-command-for-slack.html

# Bartbot Slash command:
`/bartbot` command returns Bart Schedule for the next 4 Trains based on the user input and displays the following information: 


- Trip Fare
- Trip Time
- CO2 emissions saved
- Departure Time
- Arrival Time

### How to use the `/bartbot` command:
Enter `/bartbot` followed by Origin and Destination Stations using 4 letter abbreviations [listed below](#list-of-station-abbreviations)

For example:
`/bartbot mont phil`  - this will display *Next 4 Trains from Montgomery st (SF) to Pleasant Hill*

### Nice to add features (Phase 2):

- `/bartbot stations` that will show abbreviations of all the Stations
- `/bartbot map` - shows the map of Bart system
- Ability to recognize full or partial Stations name
- Ability to specify Departure or Arrival time and show schedule based on that time
- It would be nice to have some form of Error handling. For example when user enters an incorrect abbreviation of a Bart Station, slash command would return meaningful message instead of 503 service error
